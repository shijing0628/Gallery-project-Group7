# Folder structure:

Each page has html file.

For css folder: general.css including header, navbar and footer style and will be included in each html file.

In css folder each html page related to one css file, such as gallery.html -> gallery.css.

Js folder included all js functions for different pages. index.js has slider feature for home page, data.js stored the submenu list info. admin.js -->admin-main1.html and admin->category.html. (admin-main.html is our old version, not be included for current version). category-people.js for category-people.html page. submenu.js for display submenu feature.

images folder included all images for our project.

# Regarding to our current project instruction, there are several extra features we added:

Consider adding a submenu for nav bar items, adding this menu info by using data.js file instead of editing code in each html file. More convenient for maintenance in future.

Consider adding sign up, forget password and login page before jump into admin dashboard. Make a correct flow for web design user experience.
For most of team members doing their practice, we build 4 different styles about gallery category pages.

Add mobile version hamburger menu for nav bar.

Consider UX for each page. (All contents are in containers, try to display all info in the middle of the page. Not very wide. )

Adding social media icons to link to different social platform.
